                                Rascal, a one-year-old shepherd mix, found himself in an animal hospital after a mass pull from a shelter. Living in a chaotic and stressful environment, Rascal developed intense behaviors, leaving the staff at a loss for how to handle him and jeopardizing his adoptability. Recognizing the urgent need for a solution, hospital manager Michelle and lead tech Dana reached out to me. As someone who worked in animal hospitals as a vet tech previously, I had a strong desire to educate people on preventing unnecessary euthanasia and appreciated the opportunity to take on this challenge.

                            <p>
                                The initial session involved a comprehensive assessment of Rascal's behavior and the dynamics of his relationship with his people. From there, we started creating a structured routine for Rascal's outdoor time with long-line exercises. With these exercises, I aimed to redirect their approach from restraining Rascal's movements, which can cause anxiety; or allowing him to tear across the yard completely untethered, which was fueling his excitability and defense drive. The use of the long-line helped disperse Rascal's energy and gave him a chance to release adrenaline without being overly pressurized by someone yanking him closer on the leash. After a few minutes, Rascal began to use his adrenaline to figure out the patterns Michelle & Dana were making and how much space he was being allowed to have. Creating this pressure/release pattern allowed Rascal to shift from an over-adrenalized state to a more present mindset, gradually establishing his sense of pack drive. Michelle and Dana came to realize that the quality of exercise for dogs is just as important as the quantity.<br /><br />
                                During subsequent sessions, I introduced place work on a raised cot and helped Rascal's people develop their sense of communication with him. As Michelle and Dana maintained consistency and led with intention, Rascal's behavior began to shift. I admired that despite the limitations of their busy veterinary lifestyle, they remained committed to Rascal's training. When we took our training sessions to the local park, they got a chance to apply the techniques they had learned at the hospital and practiced long-line work with increased confidence. The breakthrough came when they realized their power to change Rascal's perception of his environment by staying present and redirecting their anxieties.<br /><br />
                                By the final session, Rascal had shown remarkable improvement. Walking past numerous people in the park while remaining calm and present demonstrated the effectiveness of our training. Michelle and Dana each had individual time with Rascal, experiencing the positive changes in his behavior firsthand. The once mouthy and battle-ready dog had become more at ease in his surroundings.</p>

                                <p>
                                Beyond just rehabilitating Rascal's behavior, the training process profoundly impacted Michelle and Dana's relationship with him and the other animals under their care. They started taking Rascal out on their lunch breaks, and by keeping consistent with what they learned, he eventually became ready for adoption. Michelle and Dana also learned to approach animals calmly and avoid transferring their anxieties onto any animal.<br /><br />

                                Proper training can transform pet behavior and promote well-being for both pet and person. Rascal's success story shows that instead of trying to change ourselves or our dogs, we only need to learn to see things through a dog's eyes. By doing so, we learn to not just bypass or correct dogs' behavior but to peel back the layers of understanding beneath it. When humans set strong boundaries and make their intentions clear, it helps fulfill and support a dog's needs. When a dog's needs are met, we open up the opportunity to reveal their true spirit.<br /><br />
                                Michelle and Dana's experience with Rascal had a positive impact on his life and theirs, and I'm grateful for the chance to have worked with them.

                                Yasmeen really educated us humans on how to change our behaviors to give Rascal the structure and skills to calm down and use his brain to regulate his body/mind. He has a chance at life now and is blossoming into all the things that a happy dog should be. We cannot thank Yasmeen enough for helping to transform our skills to change Rascal's life.
